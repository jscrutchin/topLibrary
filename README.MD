Library App from The Odin Project

https://toplibraryjs.web.app/

It isn't the prettiest app but I learned a lot about manipulating the DOM while creating this simple library app.

I had some issues that I encountered that I learned were due to the nature of 'this' in JavaScript and the way it behaves.

It is not super pretty on mobile devices but that is okay as that was not the purpose of this project. I will make mobile friendly apps in the future.

It is deployed using Firebase, and uses local storage to store user data.

I may go back and add Database functionality to this in the future, but I may just do that on my next project.

This is a basic library application. 

I learned a lot about manipulating the DOM with this small project.

I ran into some roadblocks with the "this" keyword and arrow functions, it was a nice learning experience.

I did not make it mobile optimized, I will begin optimizing for mobile in the future on larger projects.
